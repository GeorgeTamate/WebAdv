George Garcia Tamate

app.js: Create a program that outputs the four parts of an URL: 
Protocol, Hostname, Port, Path to the console.

app2.js: Create a program that outputs the HTTP Request message 
as text to the console.

app3.js: Create a program that outputs all of the header fields 
passed in an HTTP Request message as a JSON object to the console.

app4.js: Create a program that outputs the HTTP method, Path, Port, 
and Header fields as a JSON object on the body of the Web server's response.

IMPORTANT: The program that undergoes the tests is coded in "app4.js".
